    <h1> Guillermo Morales </h1>
    <p>I'm a student at Cerritos College pursuing a degree in technology. 
    Technology has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember, I 
    like everything about it. I look forward to consolidating my knowledge 
    and pursuit a carreer utilizing everthing I've learned. 
    Personally, I'm a cuban immigrant. I've been in the country for 20 years. 
    I used to like fishing, I dont have the time to do so. I mostly 
    work to keep up with bills and education. I have a library that I've been 
    dying to read. I like to learn stuff. </p>
    <p>Free time<br>

        <ul>Work on my beach body</ul>
